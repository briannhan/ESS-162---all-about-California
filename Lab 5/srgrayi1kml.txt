  Description:
    Abstract:
      The grayscale North America shaded relief data were derived from the 
      GTOPO30 elevation data.  GTOPO30 is a global digital elevation model (DEM) 
      with a horizontal grid spacing of 30 arc seconds (approximately 1 
      kilometer).  GTOPO30 was derived from several raster and vector sources of
      topographic information.  It was developed between 1993 and 1996 through 
      a collaborative effort led by staff at the U.S. Geological Survey's 
      National Center for EROS.  The following organizations participated by 
      contributing funding or source data: the National Aeronautics and Space
      Administration (NASA), the United Nations Environment Programme/Global 
      Resource Information Database (UNEP/GRID), the U.S. Agency for 
      International Development (USAID), the Instituto Nacional de Estadistica 
      Geografica e Informatica (INEGI) of Mexico, the Geographical Survey 
      Institute (GSI) of Japan, Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research of New 
      Zealand, and the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research (SCAR).  
    Purpose:
      The grayscale shaded relief image were developed to portray the terrain 
      of North America.  It is intended for visual purposes only.  The original 
      GTOPO30 data must be used for conducting analysis and determining 
      elevation values.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        The mosaic of elevation data used for North America Shaded Relief was 
        first assembled in 1999 for use on the National Atlas web site, and for 
        a printed color map at 1:10,000,000 scale published that same year.  The 
        original 1999 map layer was assembled from the following tiles of 
        GTOPO30 elevation data: w180n90, w140n90, w100n90, w060n90, w020n90, 
        w180n40, w140n40, w100n40, w060n40, w020n40.  The tiles were ingested 
        into Arc/INFO with the IMAGEGRID command.  The resulting grids were 
        combined into a single grid with the MERGE function.  This grid was then 
        projected into the Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection, centered on 
        100 degrees West, 45 degrees North.  The .prj file used for the Arc 
        PROJECT command contained these parameters:
        > INPUT
        > PROJECTION GEOGRAPHIC
        > UNITS DD
        > PARAMETERS
        > OUTPUT
        > PROJECTION LAMBERT_AZIMUTHAL
        > UNITS METERS
        > XSHIFT 0.0
        > YSHIFT 0.0
        > PARAMETERS
        > 0.0
        > -100 0 0
        > 45 0 0
        > 0.0
        > 0.0
        > END
        >
        The western edge of the grid was extended to match that of the National 
        Atlas of the United States Map Maker bounding rectangle, and the null 
        cells in the extended area were converted to ocean color values using 
        CON.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        In 2001 and 2002, some areas of the elevation mosaic were updated with 
        improved data provided as internal files by science staff at EROS Data 
        Center.  The first update, in October, 2001 featured two significant 
        improvements:  1. Much of the GTOPO30 coverage of the conterminous 
        United States was updated from higher resolution elevation data from the 
        National Elevation Dataset;  2. Parts of northern Canada were corrected 
        to remove a processing artifact that created an artificial pattern of 
        "dimples" in the shaded relief.  These elevation data were used for a 
        printed National Atlas product, the 2002 "Shaded Relief of North 
        America" map published at 1:10,000,000 scale. 

        In the second update, in September, 2002, data for Greenland were 
        entirely replaced by a higher resolution dataset that, however, suffered 
        from geometric distortion.  These new data for Greenland were adjusted 
        to correct for geometric distortion in the northwest part of the island 
        between the Robeson Channel and Cape Morris Jesup, and to improve 
        registration with the coastline derived from World Vector Shoreline 
        (WVS).  A link coverage was created in ArcEdit containing links between 
        the original Greenland data and the new coastline.  The link coverage 
        was used in the Arc ADJUST command to perform a linear transformation 
        with bilinear resampling on the original image, stored as an Arc/INFO 
        grid dataset.  The resulting image is geometrically correct and fits the 
        WVS coastline.  This correction was applied to data for Greenland only.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Using the Arc/INFO Polygrid command, a 0/1 land/water mask was created 
        for North America, using coastline data clipped from the National Atlas 
        shoreline file.  The land/water mask was applied to the 16-bit elevation 
        grid.  The masked elevation grid as well as the mask itself is available 
        on request.

        A grayscale shaded relief rendition of the elevation data was created 
        with the Grid HILLSHADE command using these parameters:
        >azimuth = 315 degrees
        >sun elevation = 45 degrees
        >Shadetype = SHADE
        >Vertical exaggeration = 10.0

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        To set colors for oceans the grayscale shaded relief image was first 
        converted to index color in Photoshop.  Pixel value 255 was already 
        reserved for water pixels, and so index 255 was set to rgb value (132, 
        193, 255), the blue color for oceans used in the National Atlas online 
        Map Maker.

        Masked images from Photoshop were saved as TIFF's, then ingested into 
        Arc/INFO's Grid module, saved as TIFF's from Arc/INFO, and then 
        processed through a USGS GeoTIFF software program to create fully-
        compliant GeoTIFFs with valid header information.
